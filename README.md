# Awale Game Rules

## Objective

The objective of the game is to collect as many seeds as possible from the board by moving them strategically.

## Game Set Up

The game is played on a board with 12 holes on each side and 48 seeds. Each player controls the 6 holes on their side of the board and their goal hole. The seeds are evenly distributed among the holes, with 4 seeds per hole.

## Game Play

On each turn, a player chooses one of their holes and collects all the seeds in that hole. The player then distributes the seeds, dropping one in each consecutive hole in a counter-clockwise direction. The player's goal hole is skipped during this process. If the last seed falls into the player's goal hole, they get another turn. If the last seed falls into an empty hole on the player's side, and the opposite hole contains seeds, the player captures both their last seed and the seeds in the opposite hole. Captured seeds are placed in the player's goal hole. 

## End of Game

The game ends when one player has no seeds in their holes. The player with the most seeds in their goal hole is the winner.
